            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Many years ago, in my little <a href="../../quotes/all">book of quotes</a>, I connected two thoughts by Charles Péguy and Michel Foucault, both dedicated to observation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You must always say what you see: but above all, and it is more difficult, you must always see what you see.</p>
<p>Charles Péguy (<a href="https://www.radiofrance.fr/franceculture/peguy-et-ses-cahiers-de-la-quinzaine-4368810">Radio France</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Curiosity is a vice that has been stigmatized by Christianity, philosophy, and even by a certain conception of science. Curiosity, frivolity. Yet, I like the word; it evokes care; it evokes the attention we give to what exists (&hellip;) ; a certain determination to break free from our familiarities and to look at the same things differently (&hellip;). I dream of a new age of curiosity.</p>
<p>Michel Foucault (interview with C. Delacampagne, Le Monde, n°10945, April 6 1980)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, over these years, I felt that I was missing a link to fully illuminate my own thoughts on the subject.</p>
<p>I did not entirely understand why these texts resonated so deeply with me but weren’t as &ldquo;actionable&rdquo; as I would have liked.</p>
<p>Today, though, a thought by Viktor Shklovsky, which had also been sitting in my book of quotes for years, but in a completely different section, suddenly imposed itself as the link I was seeking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Automatism devours things […] And it is precisely to restore the sensation of life, to feel objects, for the stone to be stone, that what we call art exists. Art is made to give the sensation of the thing as perceived, not as recognized.</p>
<p>Viktor Shklovsky (Art as Device, 1917)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Drawing the line between automated and perceptive looks.</p>
<p>To see what we see, for Péguy, and to insist on breaking free from our familiarities and looking at the same things differently, for Foucault, only takes observing familiar things as if they were foreign, looking at them with fresh eyes, giving them more than the superficial attention that recognized, familiar objects are often limited to. Making the effort to look in order to perceive, not merely to recognize. This is what I now understand from Foucault’s and Péguy’s words, thanks to Shklovsky&rsquo;s. It has taken me years.</p>
