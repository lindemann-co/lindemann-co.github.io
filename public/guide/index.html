<p>My background is described <a href="about">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="biases">Biases</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Action</strong>: I prefer action over inaction. However, I also believe in thoughtful planning and anticipation as essential actions. If you find me rushing too quickly, please feel free to provide patient guidance.</li>
<li><strong>Communication Intensity</strong>: I value more communication over less. If you ever feel overwhelmed by my messages, don&rsquo;t hesitate to let me know, and I&rsquo;ll reciprocate the feedback if needed.</li>
<li><strong>Explicit Communication</strong>: I lean towards explicit communication rather than implicit. I&rsquo;m working on improving in this area, especially during one-on-one discussions and planning meetings, as my experiences in Asia have shown me the importance of this balance.</li>
<li><strong>Empowerment</strong>: I prefer giving more autonomy. This means starting with close collaboration, including a lot of communication and tracking, and gradually reducing it as trust and understanding develop.</li>
<li><strong>Expressing Disagreements</strong>: If you disagree with something in a discussion, proposal, or decision, please voice your thoughts. Do so constructively and respectfully; it helps correct any potential blind spots and ensures a healthy team alignment.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="interactions">Interactions</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Balancing Company Goals and Relationships</strong>: I strive to maintain a balance between fostering positive interpersonal relationships and achieving ambitious company objectives within our team. If you feel this balance is compromised due to personal factors or company constraints, please communicate your concerns.</li>
<li><strong>Iterations</strong>: I often work iteratively. If you message me, expect a concise initial response. Additional details and nuances will follow based on your reactions. This approach helps prevent long, off-topic responses.</li>
</ul>
