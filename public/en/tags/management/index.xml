      <description>I sometimes meet founders unsure of their ability to scale their organization. One reason is that they compare their practices with what they think exists at Google or Facebook.&#xA;Since I started two companies myself1 and also managed teams at Google, I&amp;rsquo;d like to share my two cents here.&#xA;Don&amp;rsquo;t try to apply inapplicable processes First, scaling your organization doesn&amp;rsquo;t require adopting methods published by Google, Netflix, or Amazon. These companies are facing problems and have ressources (human, financial and technological) that are irrelevant to most companies.</description>
