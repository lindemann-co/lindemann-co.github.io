I sometimes meet founders unsure of their ability to scale their organization. One reason is that they compare their practices with what they think exists at Google or Facebook.

Since I started two companies myself[^1] and also managed teams at Google, I'd like to share my two cents here.

## Don't try to apply inapplicable processes
First, scaling your organization doesn't require adopting methods published by Google, Netflix, or Amazon. These companies are facing problems and have ressources (human, financial and technological) that are irrelevant to most companies.

More importantly, many orgs in these companies are largely unable to adopt these best practices themselves.

Consider [Project Oxygen](https://www.betterup.com/blog/project-oxygen): certain highly successful divisions at Google only trust Technical Lead Managers (TLMs) and have no Engineering Managers. From SWE to Senior Director, everyone is on the individual contributor track even if their daily role is people management. Written injunctions from the VP and SVP to phase out TLMs in favor of pairs combining a TL with an EM are simply ignored by middle managers. This has weird implications, e.g. TLs unwilling to assume managerial duties find themselves forced with people responsibilities.

Another great example is the [Google SRE books](https://sre.google/books/): even when dealing with systems at the scale and complexity of Google, it is impossible for Google SRE leadership to constantly identify and assign software development projects to all their SRE engineers. As a result, many of them spend a significant portion of their time on repetitive manual tasks.

Don't get me wrong, the leaders of these organizations are predominantly competent, intelligent and genuinely concerned about their teams' well-being. They do their best to achieve their objectives with the resources available and within their personal limitations, much like any pragmatic leader would do.

So, how come a company like Google lets entire divisions stray away from the best practices the whole company advocates for?

## Standards come from isolated geeks

So, again, don't measure yourself against ideal recommendations that even well established organisations can't apply. Keep finding people and processes that work in your context.
