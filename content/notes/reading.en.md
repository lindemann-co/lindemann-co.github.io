Don't expect this site to enlighten you with timeless and dazzling knowledge that its author, speaking of himself in the third person because it sounds nice, would have acquired over the course of their rich and remarkable life.

On the contrary, most of the guiding compasses used by the aforementioned author were originally expressed by others, either orally or in writing, and are so publicly available that they are listed below.

Notes:
1. The descriptions are taken from the publications themselves.
1. Each source is illustrated with an example of content that particularly interested the author of these lines.
