I previously mentioned the importance I attach to observation[^1].

Among the domains where this quality seems particularly important to me, even indispensable, I place recruitment. Indeed, I pay very close attention to the elements I wish to observe during the hiring process and during the first few months after a new employee joins.

Perhaps one day I will deserve the Al Pacinesque title of "scary judge of talent."
