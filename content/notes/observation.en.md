The sense of observation is rarely mentioned as a factor of success in our personal or professional lives.

The video below corrects this injustice in less than 90 seconds.

{{< youtube id="1AaOAYYzGgI" title="Coaching Someone Up, One Detail at a Time" >}}

Published on LinkedIn[^1], this video is accompanied by comments praising various qualities of coach [BriAnna Garza](https://shootersxshoot70.training/): her humility when she apologizes for not acting sooner, her pedagogical sense when she remains silent after a missed shot, or her enthusiasm when she shouts to the player that he is a true shooter.

However, it's the observation talent of this coach before and during the session that impressed me the most.


## Before the session
Dozens of physical parameters determine the quality of a shot: position and firmness of the feet, ankles, knees, pelvis, back, neck, shoulders, elbows, wrists, and all the bones in the hand, including the palm and fingers. Each of these degrees of freedom evolves dynamically from ball grip to release when the ball leaves the fingertips.

To "correct" an imperfect gesture, one must have a very precise vision of the target to be reached, visualizing the "correct" gesture to strive for.

BriAnna Garza probably couldn't have identified that the angle formed by the elbow at the precise moment of body straightening needed correction if she hadn't previously built an extremely clear vision of the ideal angle at that particular moment of the movement: "Don't collapse your arm (...) like, if you had an egg right here, don't break it." I find this image remarkably clear and effective, and I think about the time it took to observe matches or training sessions to build it so clearly[^2].


## During the session
It appears that the session initially focused on footwork. However, the video shows BriAnna Garza correcting the player's arm fold.

To redirect the session and identify that the parameter to work on primarily was actually the elbow angle at the precise moment when the player's body straightens, BriAnna Garza had to observe in detail and over a large number of shots every parameter of this specific player's movement, from ball grip to release. She had to assess the severity of each imperfection, ignore the "noise" of minor imperfections to finally identify the priority correction: the elbow angle when the body straightens. So, I'm not surprised by the caption specifying that 50 minutes had passed between the start of the session and the coach's intervention.


## Creating and Sharing Knowledge
Finally, this video shows nothing less than a passing of knowledge: "to improve your shot, keep your arm open like this." However, without the prior observation of hundreds of players, there wouldn't have been knowledge of the correct gesture. Without the specific observation of this particular player, there wouldn't have been transmission.

Coaching an individual or a team up requires defining and sharing an effective vision of the actions to be taken. This video shows how acute observation contributes to this.
