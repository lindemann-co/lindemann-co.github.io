## Who

I am a husband and father of two.

I am an engineer, entrepreneur and computer scientist.

I was born in France in the early 1980’s.

## Where

I live in Lausanne, Switzerland.

I also lived and worked in France, in Vietnam, in Malaysia and in the U.S.

I have been working remotely or with distributed teams for 15+ years.

## What

When I am not busy teaching my kids how to use a glue gun, I manage tech organizations, mostly building or turning them around.

If you want to know more about my experience, take a look at my [LinkedIn profile](../cv) or [book a call](../cal).

I’ll also be happy to talk with you about your projects, especially if they involve interesting challenges.

Finally, I also maintain a website dedicated to hyper-sensitivity to light[^1], which I suffer from since 2023.

## Why

> It would be disingenuous of us to disguise the fact that the principal motive which prompted the work was the sheer fun of the thing.
>
> Alan Turing
